      <p class="intro-text">
        Malaysia’s 2022 economy shows a clear mix of progress and inequality.
        Although the country has reached middle-income status, big gaps remain,
        between cities and rural areas, resource-rich and agriculture-based
        states, and people with different education levels. Understanding these
        patterns helps both policymakers tackling income inequality and
        individuals planning their careers or where to live. The visualizations
        below combine official household and salary data to show the nation’s
        economic opportunities and challenges.

      <h2>Regional Income Distribution Across Malaysia</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        Economic prosperity in Malaysia is
        <b>concentrated in major cities and resource-rich regions</b>. The
        Federal Territories, especially Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, benefit from
        the presence of government services, financial centers, and
        multinational companies. States like Selangor also gain from their
        proximity to the capital and strong industrial development. In contrast,
        rural states continue to face economic challenges despite their rich
        culture and agricultural potential. These regional differences reflect
        decades of policy decisions, infrastructure investments, and migration
        trends.
      </p>
      <div class="vis-container" id="map"></div>
      <p class="section-text">
        Beyond average incomes, two indicators reveal deeper economic realities.
        The <b>Gini coefficient</b> measures income inequality, where values
        closer to 0 mean more equal income distribution, while those closer to 1
        indicate greater inequality. The <b>poverty rate</b> shows the
        percentage of households living below the national poverty line, unable
        to meet basic needs. Interestingly, higher average incomes don’t always
        mean fairer wealth distribution, as some rich states still have wide
        gaps between the wealthy and the poor. These measures show that true
        economic development isn’t just about income growth, but also about how
        fairly prosperity is shared across society.
      </p>

      <h2>Income vs Expenditure: State Comparison</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        The relationship between how much Malaysians earn and spend offers key
        insights into financial resilience across the country. High-income
        states don’t always have higher savings as rising living costs,
        especially housing and urban expenses, can reduce the benefits of higher
        pay. The Federal Territories, for example, enjoy strong incomes but face
        heavy living costs that narrow the gap between earnings and spending. In
        contrast, some states with moderate incomes manage better savings due to
        lower living costs and different spending habits.
      </p>
      <div class="vis-container" id="barchart"></div>
      <p class="section-text">
        The poverty rate filter highlights an important trend: states with
        higher poverty levels often have smaller gaps between income and
        expenditure, showing that many households live paycheck to paycheck with
        little financial security. This makes them especially vulnerable to
        economic shocks, medical bills, or unexpected costs. Recognizing these
        regional differences is crucial for creating social safety nets and
        economic policies that focus not only on boosting income, but also on
        improving affordability and financial stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding Household Savings Patterns</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
        <div class="chart" id="slopechart"></div>
        <div class="text">
          <p class="section-text">
            The slope chart visualizes how each state transitions from mean
            income to mean expenditure. Each line represents a state, connecting
            its income level to its expenditure level.
            <b>Steeper downward slopes</b> indicate states with
            <b>higher savings rates</b>, while flatter slopes suggest that
            households spend most of their income. The Federal Territories earn
            the most but spend heavily, limiting savings. Meanwhile, states like
            Kelantan and Sabah earn less but adjust their spending better.
            Still, lower absolute savings mean less protection in crises.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Overall, the extremes seen in the dropdown highlight Malaysia’s
            diverse economic landscape, from high-earning, high-spending urban
            areas to lower-income but more cost-conscious rural communities,
            each facing different financial realities and challenges.

      <h2>Salary Insights: Education and Experience</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
        Education plays a major role in shaping salary trends in Malaysia, but
        the returns from higher degrees vary widely. Master’s and PhD holders
        often start with higher salaries, yet after 15–20 years of experience,
        pay levels across all education groups tend to converge. This suggests
        that work experience and expertise eventually become just as valuable as
        formal qualifications. The wide salary ranges within each education
        level also show that a degree alone doesn’t determine income, where
        industry, negotiation skills, company size, and location all make a big
        difference. In fact, some Bachelor’s degree holders in high-demand
        fields or leadership roles earn more than PhD holders in academia or
        research.

        <div class="chart" id="scatterplot"></div>
      </div>

      <p class="section-text">
        The experience slider highlights another key pattern: early-career
        professionals experience the fastest salary growth, while pay increases
        slow down in mid to late career stages. This “plateau effect” shows the
        importance of pursuing promotions, upskilling, or changing industries to
        maintain salary momentum. The bubble size, representing age, shows most
        Malaysian professionals fall between their late 20s and early 50s,
        reflecting both the nation’s workforce demographics and typical career
        spans before retirement.
